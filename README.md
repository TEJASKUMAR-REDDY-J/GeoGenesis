# GeoGenesis

**Project Description:**

GeoGenesis is an innovative project designed to autonomously generate detailed and accurate 3D geographical models of complex environments using a swarm of drones. By integrating Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and intelligent agentic pipelines, GeoGenesis enables efficient exploration and data acquisition in challenging terrains such as quarries, forests, mines, and nuclear sites. This project aims to provide a robust platform for environmental monitoring, surveying, and analysis.

**Key Features:**

* **Swarm-Based Mapping:** Employs a coordinated drone swarm for comprehensive and rapid environmental coverage.
* **Real-time SLAM:** Utilizes advanced SLAM algorithms to generate precise 3D maps in real-time, facilitating dynamic exploration.
* **Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Exploration:** Trains drones using RL to optimize exploration strategies, adapt to unforeseen obstacles, and maximize data collection efficiency.
* **Intelligent Agentic Pipelines:** Leverages agentic frameworks to manage task allocation, dynamic decision-making, and function calling, enabling context-aware operations.
* **Modular and Scalable Architecture:** Designed for flexibility and adaptability, allowing seamless integration of diverse sensors and algorithms.
* **Real-time Data Visualization and Analysis:** Provides immediate visual feedback and analytical tools for informed decision-making.
* **Context-Specific Function Calls:** Agents are capable of calling various functions depending on the scenario, such as radiation level analysis in nuclear sites, or mineral composition in mines.

**Technologies Used:**

* **SLAM:** ROS2 Navigation2, ORB-SLAM3, or similar
* **RL:** TensorFlow Agents, PyTorch RL, or custom RL implementations
